          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>elements, such as the < meta > and < title > elements, are nested inside the < head > element.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience. </li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as < div > to create a division in the page, or < span > to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The < h1 > is the opening tag and < /h1 > is the closing tag.</li>
          <li>The content between those tags is what is rendered on the page.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A link at the bottom of the meta data of the head of your HTML is needed to have your CSS changes shown</li>
          <li>If applying the same attributes to multiple sections such as < h1 > and < h2 > you only need to write that code once.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Coding files are processed top down: so for JavaScript to have affect it's link is put at the bottom of the code</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the < head > element, the script.js file is linked within the < body > element.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website</li>
          <li>You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line.</li>
          <li>Some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable</li>
          <li>There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use semicolons. </li>
          <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name: myVariable; </li>
          <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code: let myVariable = "Bob"; myVariable = "Steve"; </li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false.</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. </li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically</li>
          <li>To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
