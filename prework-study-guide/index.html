          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>elements, such as the < meta > and < title > elements, are nested inside the < head > element.</li>
          <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience. </li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage</li>
          <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
          <li>It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as < div > to create a division in the page, or < span > to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>The < h1 > is the opening tag and < /h1 > is the closing tag.</li>
          <li>The content between those tags is what is rendered on the page.</li>
